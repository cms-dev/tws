These files are Python modules that provide tools to manage country
codes in ISO 3166 alpha-2, ISO 3166 alpha-3 and IOI format (which is
identical to the IOC one, with the exceptions of Macau and Taiwan).

You can find tools to convert between these three formats and to get
a corresponding human-readable name.

The IOI codes refer to IOI 2012.

To use some of the modules you need the following file:

    /usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_3166.xml

It is usually provided by the _iso-codes_ package.
